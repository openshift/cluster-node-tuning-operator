# NOTE: NetworkPolicy behaviour for hostNetwork pods (tuned) is undefined
# https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#networkpolicy-and-hostnetwork-pods
# Add rules for tuned pods even though most network plugins are unable to
# distinguish hostNetwork pod traffic from all other traffic.

# The "default" policy for a namespace which denies all ingress and egress traffic.
# This ensures that even pods that aren't selected by any other NetworkPolicy will
# not be allowed ingress or egress traffic.

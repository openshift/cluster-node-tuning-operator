The functional tests (functests) are split across suites as follows:

0_config: should be run before other in order to config the environment, thus, deploy PerformanceProfile:
    - Create PerformanceProfile
    - Wait for the MCP to pick PerformanceProfile MC
    - Wait for the MCP being updated
This deployment takes some time and requires reboot

1_performance: Performance performance test: Should run after config and before update ones
2_performance_update: Performance update: Update test, should run after performance ones
    - Apply different PerformanceProfiles and its updates to check if changes has been applied correctly
3_performance_status: Check the status of different objects related with PAO
4_latency: Runs tests of latency measurement tools and verifies the measurements are in the expected range according to the values of the latency environment variables
5_latency_testing: Runs the tests of suite 4_Latency with different values of environment variables to validate that the main tests are properly executed, skipped, or failed when needed.
6_mustgather_testing: Check if must-gather cluster generated data is correct 

Tests are executed in order of file-names
So be careful with renaming existing or adding new suites

DISCOVERY_MODE env variable to get an already deployed performanceProfile
If DISCOVERY_MODE set to true the suites will search for a PerformanceProfile on the cluster and use it.
If no PerformanceProfile is found, that suites will be skipped

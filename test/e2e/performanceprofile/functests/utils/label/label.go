package label

// The label package contains a list of labels that can be used in
// the functests to indicate and point certain behavior or characteristics
// of the various tests.
// Those can be filtered/focused by ginkgo before the test runs.

// Kind is a label indicates specific criteria that classify the test.
// A Mixture of kinds can be used for the same test
type Kind string

// Feature is a label indicates the feature that being tested.

// that should roughly describe the execution complexity, maintainer identity and processing criteria.

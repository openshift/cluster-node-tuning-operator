# This is a workaround to prevent TuneD running in the container from reporting
# ERROR    tuned.utils.commands: Executing grub2-editenv error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'grub2-editenv': 'grub2-editenv'
# message while keeping the [bootloader] plug-in working.  Note that every ERROR message
# emitted by TuneD will result in Tuned Profile going into Degraded status, so we want
# to limit unnecessary ERROR reporting.

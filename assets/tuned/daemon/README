TuneD: Daemon for monitoring and adaptive tuning of system devices.

(This is tuned 2.0 with a new code base. If you are looking for the older
version, please check out branch '1.0' in our Git repository.)

How to use it
-------------

TuneD is incompatible with the cpupower and power-profiles-daemon. If you
have these services, uninstall or disable them.

In Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and their derivates install tuned package
(optionally tuned-utils, tuned-utils-systemtap, and tuned-profiles-compat):

# dnf install tuned

After the installation, start the tuned service:

# systemctl start tuned

You might also want to run tuned whenever your machine starts:

# systemctl enable tuned

If the daemon is running you can easily control it using 'tuned-adm' command
line utility. This tool communicates with the daemon over DBus. Any user can
list the available profiles and see which one is active. But the profiles can
be switched only by root user or by any user with physical console allocated
on the machine (X11, physical tty, but no SSH).

To see the current active profile, run:

# tuned-adm active

To list all available profiles, run:

# tuned-adm list

To switch to a different profile, run:

# tuned-adm profile <profile-name>

Your profile choice is also written into /etc/tuned/active_profile and this
choice is used when the daemon is restarted (e.g. with the machine reboot).

To disable all tunings, run:
# tuned-adm off

To show information/description of given profile or current profile if no profile is specified, run:
# tuned-adm profile_info

To verify current profile against system settings, run:
# tuned-adm verify

To enable automatic profile selection mode, switch to the recommended profile, run:
# tuned-adm auto_profile

To show current profile selection mode, run:
# tuned-adm profile_mode

# tuned-adm recommend
Recommend profile suitable for your system. Currently only static detection is
implemented - it decides according to data in /etc/system-release-cpe and
virt-what output. The rules for autodetection are defined in the file
/usr/lib/tuned/recommend.d/50-tuned.conf. They can be overridden by the user by
putting a file to /etc/tuned/recommend.d or a file named recommend.conf into
/etc/tuned (see tuned-adm(8) for more details). The default rules recommend
profiles targeted to the best performance or the balanced profile if unsure.

Available tunings
-----------------

We are currently working on many new tuning features. Some are described in
the manual pages, some are yet undocumented.

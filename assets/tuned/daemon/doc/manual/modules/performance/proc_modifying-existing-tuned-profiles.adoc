= Modifying existing TuneD profiles

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure creates a modified child profile based on an existing *TuneD* profile.

.Prerequisites

ifndef::pantheonenv[]
* The `tuned` service is running. See xref:installing-and-enabling-tuned_getting-started-with-tuned[Installing and Enabling Tuned] for details.

.Procedure

. In the [filename]`/etc/tuned/` directory, create a new directory named the same as the profile that you want to create:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
# mkdir /etc/tuned/[replaceable]_modified-profile_
----

. In the new directory, create a file named [filename]`tuned.conf`, and set the `[main]` section as follows:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
[main]
include=[replaceable]_parent-profile_
----
+
Replace [replaceable]_parent-profile_ with the name of the profile you are modifying.

. Include your profile modifications.

.Lowering swappiness in the throughput-performance profile
====
To use the settings from the `throughput-performance` profile and change the value of `vm.swappiness` to 5, instead of the default 10, use:

----
[main]
include=throughput-performance

[sysctl]
vm.swappiness=5
----
====
--

. To activate the profile, use:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
# tuned-adm profile [replaceable]_modified-profile_
----

. Verify that the *TuneD* profile is active and the system settings are applied:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ tuned-adm active

Current active profile: [replaceable]_my-profile_
----
+
----
$ tuned-adm verify

Verfication succeeded, current system settings match the preset profile.
See TuneD log file ('/var/log/tuned/tuned.log') for details.
----

// .An alternative approach
// . Alternatively, copy the directory with a system profile from /user/lib/tuned/ to /etc/tuned/. For example:
// +
// ----
// # cp -r /usr/lib/tuned/throughput-performance /etc/tuned
// ----
//
// . Then, edit the profile in /etc/tuned according to your needs. Note that if there are two profiles of the same name, the profile located in /etc/tuned/ is loaded. The disadvantage of this approach is that if a system profile is updated after a TuneD upgrade, the changes will not be reflected in the now-outdated modified version.

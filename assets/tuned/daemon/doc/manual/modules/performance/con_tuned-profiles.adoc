= TuneD profiles

[role="_abstract"]
A detailed analysis of a system can be very time-consuming. *TuneD* provides a number of predefined profiles for typical use cases. You can also create, modify, and delete profiles.

The profiles provided with *TuneD* are divided into the following categories:

* Power-saving profiles
* Performance-boosting profiles

The performance-boosting profiles include profiles that focus on the following aspects:

* Low latency for storage and network
* High throughput for storage and network
* Virtual machine performance
* Virtualization host performance

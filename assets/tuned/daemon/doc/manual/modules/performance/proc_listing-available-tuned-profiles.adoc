= Listing available TuneD profiles

[role="_abstract"]
This procedure lists all *TuneD* profiles that are currently available on your system.

//No prerequisites are needed
////
.Prerequisites

* The `tuned` service is running. See xref:installing-and-enabling-tuned_{context}[] for details.

.Procedure

* To list all available *TuneD* profiles on your system, use:
+
[subs="+quotes",options="+nowrap",role=white-space-pre]
----
$ *tuned-adm list*

Available profiles:
- balanced               - General non-specialized tuned profile
- desktop                - Optimize for the desktop use-case
- latency-performance    - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption
- network-latency        - Optimize for deterministic performance at the cost of increased power consumption, focused on low latency network performance
- network-throughput     - Optimize for streaming network throughput, generally only necessary on older CPUs or 40G+ networks
- powersave              - Optimize for low power consumption
- throughput-performance - Broadly applicable tuning that provides excellent performance across a variety of common server workloads
- virtual-guest          - Optimize for running inside a virtual guest
- virtual-host           - Optimize for running KVM guests

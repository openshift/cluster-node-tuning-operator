[subs=+quotes]
----
# tuned-adm recommend

Alternatively, you can activate a combination of multiple profiles:

# tuned-adm profile [replaceable]_profile1_ [replaceable]_profile2_
----
+
.A virtual machine optimized for low power consumption
====
The following example optimizes the system to run in a virtual machine with the best performance and concurrently tunes it for low power consumption, while the low power consumption is the priority:

----
# tuned-adm profile virtual-guest powersave
----
====

. View the current active *TuneD* profile on your system:
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
# tuned-adm active

Current active profile: [replaceable]_selected-profile_
----

. Reboot the system:
+
----
# reboot
----

.Verification steps

* Verify that the *TuneD* profile is active and applied:
+
----
$ tuned-adm verify

Verification succeeded, current system settings match the preset profile.
See TuneD log file ('/var/log/tuned/tuned.log') for details.

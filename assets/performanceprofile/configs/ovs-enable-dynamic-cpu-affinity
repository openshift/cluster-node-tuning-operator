# This file enables the dynamic cpu affinity management of the OVS services
#
# It is read by the OVN's ovnkube-node DaemonSet container and the feature
# is enabled when this file exists and is not empty (this commentary text
# ensures that)
#
# For disabling this feature in emergencies, either:
# 1) delete this file and set the cpu affinity of OVS services manually
# 2) or replace the contents of this file with an empty string
#    via a MachineConfig

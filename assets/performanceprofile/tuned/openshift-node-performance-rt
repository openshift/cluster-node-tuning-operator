summary=Real time profile to override unsupported settings

[sysctl]
#Real time kernel doesn't support the following kernel parameters.
#The openshift-node-performance profile inherits these kernel parameters from the network-latency profile. 
#Therefore, if the real time kernel is detected they will be dropped, meaning won't be applied.

Make reapply_sysctl ignore configs from /usr 

The reapply_sysctl functionality was originally added to address rhbz#1302953,
which was about Tuned overriding sysctl config files from /etc, which was
deemed undesirable. The bug said nothing about sysctl config files from
/usr/lib/sysctl.d, /lib/sysctl.d or /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d.

Having sysctl configs from /usr override Tuned profiles causes problems
(rhbz#1759597). Also, it seems reasonable for Tuned profiles to override
sysctl configs from /usr - a Tuned profile is often explicitly chosen by
the user, whereas sysctl configs from /usr are provided by system packages
whether the user wants them or not.

Also, in RHEL-6, tuned used to ignore sysctl config files from /usr, as far
as I can tell.

Resolves rhbz#1759597
